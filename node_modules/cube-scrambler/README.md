Rubik's Cube Scrambler
======================

> Want a scramble? Say `scramble` on your CLI!

NPM module that can be used from the CLI as well as other NPM modules to
generate Rubik's Cube scrambles.

Huge thanks to @jnrbsn who has written the core code for this 
module. Find the original repository here: [jnrbsn/rubiks-cube-scrambler](https://github.com/jnrbsn/rubiks-cube-scrambler).

(I am just the guy who packaged it into a module!)
